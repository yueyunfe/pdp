1. Cleared all the maven issues.

2. made the project to accept the command line

3. clear the issue of missing event argument

4. give message if input file does not exist. It was terminating the project silently when found an error.

5. One question about the design part, it says:
    "checkInput() is still complex - it would be easy to break it into small methods that check
                                               different arguments."

  My explanation: I do not deny it looks like a little long. But 1st, the method does what his job for checking
  each input. 2nd, I did realize it might be a little long, so I broke it into sections and also gave comments to
  explain what each section did. So I believe I handled it properly. Maybe not perfect, but I did handle the case
