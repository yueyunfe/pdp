For the problem 4, in order to get the random course.

1st, I need to generate a random number.

2nd. Get the random course name from the array by using the generated number as the index

3rd. print out the random course name




For the problem 5,

1st, I modified the case that n<0 instead of n<=0

2nd. modified the base case which n=0 and n=1

3rd. the formula for fibonacci should be adding them together instead of minus



For the problem 6,

I designed my program asking user for an input to reverse. The valid input is only for

integer(positive or negative). If the user type a wrong format, the program will continually

asking user for a correct input.

I did a few tests which are all past. The tests include valid positive or negative numbers, invalid

double number, invalid string, invalid space and overflow.


For the problem 7,

Vehicle.java  Add a default constructor to throw an exception. Add exception for wrong format. Modified the return
              value. Tested default constructor which has no input, tested invalid direction and velocity

Highway.java  Filled every method and tested all and passed them all.

ScenicRoad.jave  Used inheritance from highway, override the add method. set the max speed to 5.0, had a formula for
                 max number of cars. Tested if speed changes when exceed the capacity.
