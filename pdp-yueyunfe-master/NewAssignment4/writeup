The main class HalloweenNeighborhoodTraversal was used to check the user input and output the result
into a csv file

The child class serves as a child who contains the information like candies that he/she desired to

The candy class is the super class for all kinds of candies

The Household class is the super class for all kinds of household

The programs used visitor design pattern to search for the desired candy.

CandyVisitor class is the one to search for the result when a candy object need to visit.

I handled the error by giving the error message. Because if we have 2 children and the 1st child

input wrong, we do not want to stop right now, we still need to process the 2nd child. So I record

how many child meet error when trying to search. Also give error message to remind the child with this id

meet an error when searching.
