    I organized my program as individual classes. Each class did their own jobs that provide necessary functions.

2.
    The major classes are patient and hospital classes. For patient class, it works as an individual patient, the patient
    has his/her own name, id, waiting time as so on.

    The Hospital class works as a real hospital, it register the patient when the patient comes, then it provide the functions
    for such as assign the patient, check room availability as so on

    I did test for ADT sorting to see if I get the order that I want.I did not have any bugs for sorting and as well as other parts.

    This is the first time I used the priority queue, I am definitely learned how to use it.

    Well, I did not run for 8 hours. But when I tested as less as 5 rooms in a high frequency patients coming, the waiting time is
    about 2 hours, which we do not want it happen in the real life. So the more room we have, the better performance will be if the
    coming frequency is instant.
